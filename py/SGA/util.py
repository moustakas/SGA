def weighted_partition(weights, n):

    Partition `weights` into `n` groups with approximately same sum(weights)

    Args:
        weights: array-like weights
        n: number of groups

    Returns list of lists of indices of weights for each group

    Notes:
        compared to `dist_discrete_all`, this function allows non-contiguous
        items to be grouped together which allows better balancing.
