# This file contains the set of objects that should not trigger
# special handling in legacypipe because they are effectively
# 'resolved' into individual stars (see cuts below).
#
# These objects all get the 'fixgeo' and 'resolved' SGAFITMODE bits.
#
# Cuts: SURFACE_BRIGHTNESS_RHALF > 26. & DIAM_INIT > 7.
