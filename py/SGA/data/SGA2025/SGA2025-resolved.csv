# This file contains the set of objects that should not trigger
# special handling in legacypipe because they are effectively
# 'resolved' into individual stars.

# This file contains a list of dwarf galaxies which are either
# resolved into individual stars or whose surface-brightness is low
# enough that no special behavior in legacypipe should be triggered.
#
# All objects in this file should also be in -fixgeo.csv file and some
# will also be in the -forcepsf.csv file.
#
# These objects all get the 'RESOLVED' SAMPLEBITS bit set.
