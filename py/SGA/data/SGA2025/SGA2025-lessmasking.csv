# This file contains galaxies in a region with a very high density of
# stellar sources, e.g., within a globular cluster, the Magellanic
# Clouds, or close to the Galactic plane.
#
# No threshold-masking of PSF or Gaia sources within the elliptical mask.
#
# These objects all get the 'LESSMASKING' SGAFITMODE bits.
